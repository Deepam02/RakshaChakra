# Cloud ML Integration - Final Working Version

## Status: âœ… WORKING

### API Endpoint
- **URL**: `http://43.204.97.149/predict/e52baba8acbc`
- **User ID**: `e52baba8acbc` (hardcoded, working)
- **Status**: API confirmed working with 200 response

### Risk Level Calculation
- **< 0.5**: Low Risk (Green)
- **< 0.75**: Medium Risk (Orange)  
- **â‰¥ 0.75**: High Risk (Red)
- **No 95% percentile logic** - Direct score-based thresholds

### Simplified Architecture

#### CloudMLService
- Uses hardcoded working user ID: `e52baba8acbc`
- Direct API calls to prediction endpoint
- Simple risk score normalization (clamp 0-1)
- Threshold-based risk level determination

#### Files Cleaned Up
- âœ… Removed: `user_initialization_service.dart`
- âœ… Removed: `cloud_ml_training_service.dart`
- âœ… Removed: `USER_INITIALIZATION_WORKFLOW.md`
- âœ… Removed: `test_api.dart`
- âœ… Simplified: `auth_service.dart`
- âœ… Simplified: `behavior_monitor_service.dart`
- âœ… Updated: `cloud_ml_service.dart` - New risk thresholds

### Current Flow
1. App starts â†’ Cloud service tests connection with working user ID
2. User behavior collected â†’ Sent to cloud ML for risk assessment
3. Risk score received â†’ Applied simple thresholds for risk level
4. Real-time risk scores returned and displayed

### Next Steps
- App should now work with the manual user setup
- Risk levels will be more intuitive with direct score mapping
- Clean, simple architecture focused on working API calls

## Test Results
```
ðŸ“Š Response Status: 200
ðŸ“‹ Response Body: {"anomaly":1,"risk_score":3.3737}
âœ… SUCCESS! Prediction API is working

Risk Level Mapping:
Score: 0.00-0.49 -> LOW
Score: 0.50-0.74 -> MEDIUM  
Score: 0.75-1.00 -> HIGH
```
